                <h2><br>Forecasting Hydrocarbon production from Fractured wells</h2>
                <h3><br><br>This project focuses on forecasting hydrocarbon production from fractured wells,
                    which are crucial for extracting oil and gas from low-permeability reservoirs like shale formations.
                     Unlike conventional reservoirs, fractured wells exhibit nonlinear flow behavior and transient
                     production phases, making forecasting more complex.</h3>


                <h3><br>The study compares two forecasting methods:


                <br>Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) A traditional empirical method using historical data to estimate production
                trends.
                <br>Machine Learning (LSTM) An advanced AI-based approach that dynamically learns complex production patterns.
                <br><br>The study concludes that while DCA is useful for general decline estimates, machine learning techniques
                 like LSTM offer higher precision for unconventional reservoirs. Future forecasting techniques will likely
                 integrate AI-driven models with real-time reservoir monitoring for better optimization.</h3>
